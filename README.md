# craps-game

This was another project assigned during my first term of studying
Computer Science. The assignment required that we write a program that
simulates the dice rolling casino game called Craps.

The game of craps allows the dice roller to wager money on what the 
outcome of rolling two dice will be. On the player's first roll, if the
die shows 7 or 11 the player wins their bet. An initial roll of 2, 3, 
or 12 is a loss, or a "craps" roll. Any other number outside of these 
outcomes will become the "set number." This set number will need to be 
rolled by the player a second time in order for the player to win their
bet. If a seven is rolled before the player can roll this set number a 
second time, the player loses the bet.
