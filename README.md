# Craps Game Simulator

This was another project assigned during my first term of studying
Computer Science. The assignment required that we write a program that
simulates the dice rolling casino game called Craps.

# What is Craps?

The game of Craps allows the dice roller to wager money on what the 
outcome of rolling two dice will be. On the player's first roll, if the
die shows 7 or 11 the player wins their bet. Although, an initial roll of 2, 3, 
or 12 is a loss, or a "craps" roll. Any other number outside of these 
outcomes will become the "point number." This point number will need to be 
rolled by the player a second time in order for the player to win their
bet. If a seven is rolled before the player can roll the point number a 
second time, the player loses the bet.
